Some transfer credits may count if they match U-M's upper-level standards and are approved by BSI advisors, but they must be carefully evaluated for equivalency.
Yes. Some courses have established grading rubrics for papers, group projects, and presentations, shared via Canvas or the course syllabus.
Instructors or BSI academic advisors can issue overrides if a course is vital to a student's plan; spots are not guaranteed, so students must request it.
Typically, a pathway is chosen during junior year orientation, and switching is possible if new requirements can still be met before graduation.
Many do pursue minors (like Computer Science or Business). It's feasible if you plan carefully with your advisor to handle both BSI and minor requirements.
Yes. AP credits often free up space for more SI electives, though AP credit usage is subject to U-M's standard AP credit policies.
Some courses introduce R, SQL, or specialized data visualization platforms. The exact toolkit depends on the instructor and current tech trends.

They typically complete it through LSA's upper-level writing courses or specific SI courses that carry upper-level writing designations.
Advisors provide a default sequence. Some rearrangement is possible, but certain courses (like SI 206) are prerequisites for advanced classes.
Many do incorporate real clients—e.g., local companies or nonprofits—to give students practical experience in user research or data analysis.
There is no formal advanced math requirement beyond standard U-M admission math. However, data-focused BSI students find it beneficial to have some familiarity with college-level math.
Yes. These include user-centered thinking, data handling, collaboration, ethics in information use, and effective communication skills.
The BSI doesn't have "studios" in the traditional sense. However, certain user-experience courses provide dedicated lab sessions for prototyping.
Team-based work is common across most terms, although some courses emphasize individual projects, especially if they focus on specialized skill development.
The Capstone sequence is the main culminating experience; a thesis is not standard, though an honors thesis can be arranged under faculty supervision.
They must still meet the 60 upper-level requirement, UMSI core, and any incomplete distribution requirements. Advisors map everything out carefully.
They vary significantly: technical classes may use coding or analytics tasks, while design/ethics courses often use essays or reflective writings.

Core classes can be larger (60–120 students), whereas advanced electives sometimes have 20–40 students.
They can mix courses, but the official transcript will reflect the declared pathway if they fulfill that set of required credits.
The program reviews curriculum each year, updating or introducing special topics courses as technology evolves.
Not required, but strongly encouraged. Many do so for internships or job searches, especially if they focus on UX.
Yes. The Engaged Learning Office or CDO occasionally arranges site visits for career exploration in southeast Michigan.
It varies by instructor. Some core lectures are recorded if the classroom supports it, but not all classes do so.
BSI students follow the UMSI Academic and Professional Integrity guidelines, plus broader UM standards.
It's more common for grad students, but BSI undergrads with interest in research can pursue independent studies or volunteer on projects.
Instructors may grant extended deadlines or alternative formats, especially if recommended by the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities.
Advisors suggest balancing the schedule: pair project-based classes with reading-heavy ones, not all at once.
Occasionally, with instructor permission and if they meet prerequisites. Credits typically count as upper-level elective credit.
UMSI Academic Success offers writing support, or they can visit the UM's Sweetland Center for Writing.
Yes. Some entrepreneurial pitch competitions exist at U-M and are open to BSI students with innovative info-related ideas.
Typically by the end of SI 206 or similar. Students often reach proficiency in fundamental Python usage within that semester.
Many return as guest speakers, mentor BSI undergrads, or attend career panels to share experiences and advice.
Generally, prerequisites can be completed during fall and winter. Summer enrollment is optional if needed to stay on track.
Collaboration is common, but final mastery deliverables typically include individual reflections or contributions to document each participant's learning.
Not automatically. Each course has separate skills to demonstrate; a separate waiver request or test is required for SI 507.
Yes, if the external certificate's courses align with MSI electives. Students must ensure total MSI credit minimums are still met.
Not formally. However, advising appointments are strongly recommended to confirm pathway progress.
Certain special topics or advanced design courses may cover modern frameworks, though offerings vary by semester.
Yes, faculty focusing on LIS can serve as mentors. Students can connect with them for guidance on library-related coursework.
Both are internship courses. SI 681 typically covers shorter experiences or fewer credits; SI 690 can accommodate a more extensive internship or bigger credit load.
Advisors share an ideal progression (SI 506 → 507 → 544 → 618 → 670/671 → 602 → Mastery). Electives differ by interest (e.g., advanced ML vs. visualization).
Most run the entire 14- to 15-week term, culminating in a final presentation or written report.
Potentially yes, if it aligns with mastery prerequisites, has an SI faculty sponsor, and addresses the required competencies.
Yes. The school or U-M often offers short intensives in data tools, especially near the start of fall term, open to MSI enrollees.
Yes, but the program typically must be completed within five years. Students should confirm any scholarship or visa constraints.
Big Data and UX tend to see heavy tech recruitment; LIS or info policy may lead to library, government, or social sector roles.
Projects often use U-M's computing clusters or cloud credits. UMSI ensures that students can access necessary computing power.
Yes, but that's uncommon; the original grade remains on the transcript, though only one version counts for credit.
They can combine electives from multiple pathways, do an integrated Mastery project bridging all three areas, and consult with advisors on synergy.
Required ethics coverage appears in core classes. Additional DEI or ethics workshops may be encouraged but not always mandatory.
Yes, the CDO occasionally hosts specialized career events. Students can also partner with relevant campus groups.
They can pick classes from both tracks, but they must still fulfill the Mastery prerequisites for whichever they finalize as their official path.
Workloads can be substantial, often including case studies, journal articles, and research-based texts, especially in info policy or social computing courses.
Yes. By completing SI 506 and 507, you build the foundation needed for advanced classes. Faculty also provide extra resources for novices.
Usually not. SI 544 is the standard stats/analysis requirement. You can request an exception with proof of equivalent background, subject to approval.
Some instructors arrange site visits. Others bring in guest speakers, depending on the course's focus.
The UMSI Computing Services team coordinates cluster or AWS/GCP sandbox access for class projects; students request accounts as needed.
The Academic Success team can connect you to peer tutors, especially if multiple students request help in a specific advanced course.
That depends on the specific path. Some instructors integrate short reflection papers into the Mastery. Others require a portfolio reflection.
Most are 3 credits, but short courses or special intensives can be 1-2 credits. The schedule of classes clarifies each.
They can collaborate, but each must produce individual reflection components to satisfy the Mastery's personal demonstration criteria.
Not as a primary focus, but certain special topics or big data courses may include IoT as part of data pipeline discussions.
Check out campus-wide data or hackathon events. The CDO or academic advisors can direct you to multi-school team sign-ups.
Some courses have lab hours with GSIs. The UMSI Engagement Center also offers group study tables and help sessions.
Typically, the student and the faculty sponsor share rights, depending on funding sources. Check the UM IP policy for details.
Each course sets its own reading. Some pathways circulate recommended reading lists among advisers or faculty leads.
