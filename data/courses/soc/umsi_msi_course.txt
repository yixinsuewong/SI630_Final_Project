Title: Online Communities (Online Communities)
Units: 3
Description: This course is intended to give students a background in theory and practice surrounding online interaction environments.  For the purpose of the course, a community is defined as a group of people who sustain interaction over time.  The group may be held together by a common identity, a collective purpose, or merely by the individual utility gained from the interactions.  An online interaction environment is an electronic forum, accessed through computers or other electronic devices, in which community members can conduct some or all of their interactions.  We will use the term eCommunity as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions.
There will be two main treads that weave through the course, based on the two main texts.  One tread will be concerned with the practical issues of design and use of online tools to support communities, and how choices that must be made in design can impact the function and style of the resulting community.  The second thread will focus on the sociological theory that provides a frame to better understand communities in general.  These theoretical pieces will provide a lens for better understanding the implications of choices made on the more practical level.

Title: Choice Architecture 
(Choice Architecture)
Units: 3
Advisory Prerequisites: SI 563
Description: Designing a system or organization for humans requires understanding not just choice and behavior motivations (good in most cases, we hope), but also learning about the reasons we blunder and make mistakes.  Thus, even when incentives are "aligned" with overall system goals, there are many instances where we make poor choices because as human beings, we are all susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of unwanted and unintended outcomes and decisions.  Our errors are what make us human, but up until now, they have been largely ignored by systems designers, whether these designers make complex public policy, manage a team or design an information system.  But knowing how people think, we can become choice architects who design environments that both yield better decision making on the part of users, and achieve behavior that is consistent with overall system goals while gaining a competitive design-edge.
The first goal of this course is to inform future information system professionals, designers and managers about human decision rules and their associated biases so that these insights can be incorporated into their design, business or management strategies.  Knowledge of these issues can be a significant source of competitive advantage because they are unknown to most information systems professionals and they are not taught in most I-schools.  The second goal of this course is to clarify how these results can be leveraged to create original and more effective systems and institutions that meet the designer's goals.

Advisory Prerequisites: SI 504
Description: This course aims to help students get started with their own data harvesting, processing, aggregation, and analysis.  Data analysis is crucial to evaluating and designing solutions and applications, as well as understanding user's information needs and use.  In many cases the data we need to access is distributed online among many webpages, stored in a database, or available in a large text file.  Often these data (e.g. web server logs) are too large to obtain and/or process manually.  Instead, we need an automated way of gathering the data, parsing it, and summarizing it, before we can do more advanced analysis.  Therefore, students will learn to use Python and its modules to accomplish these tasks in a 'quick and easy' yet useful and repeatable way.  Next, students will learn techniques of exploratory data analysis, using scripting, text parsing, structured query language, regular expressions, graphing, and clustering methods to explore data.  R modules will be used to accomplish these tasks. Students will be able to make sense of and see patterns in otherwise intractable quantities of data.

Title: Information Retrieval
(Informatn Retrieval)
Units: 3
Enforced Prerequisites: (SI 507 or Waiver) and (SI 618 or waiver) or Graduate Standing Excluding UMSI Programs
Description: Information is everywhere. We encounter it in our everyday lives in the form of E-mail, newspapers, television, the Web, and even in conversations with each other. Information is hidden in a variety of media: text, images, sounds, videos. While casual information consumers can simply enjoy its abundance and appreciate the existence of search engines that can help them find what they want, information professionals are responsible for building the underlying technology that search engines use. Building a search engine involves a lot more than indexing some documents -- information retrieval is the study of the interaction between users and large information environments. It covers concepts such as information need, documents and queries, indexing and searching, retrieval evaluation, multimedia and hypertext search, Web search, as well as bibliographical databases. In this course, students go over some classic concepts of information retrieval and then quickly jump to the current state of the art in the field, where crawlers, spiders, and hard-of-hearing personal butlers roam.

Title: Data Mining:  Methods and Applications 
(Data Mining)
Units: 3
Description: With the explosive growth of information generated from different sources, in a variety of formats, and with various qualities, information analysis has become challenging for researchers in many disciplines.  Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets.  This is a doctoral seminar course of advanced topics in data mining.  The course provides an overview of recent research topics in the field of data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems.  The course will highlight the practical applications of data mining instead of the theoretical foundations of machine learning and statistical computing.  The course materials will focus on how the information in different real world problems can be represented as particular genres, or formats of data, and how the basic mining tasks of each genre of data can be accomplished using the state-of-the-art techniques.  To this end, the course is not only suitable for doctoral students who are doing research in data mining related fields, but also for those who are consumers of data mining techniques in their own disciplines, such as natural language processing, network science, human computer interaction, economics, social computing, sociology, business intelligence, and biomedical informatics, etc.

Title: Unorthodox Research Methods 
(Unorthodox Res Meth)
Units: 3
Advisory Prerequisites: Doctoral student status
Description: Any traditional research method was once unorthodox.  While many are prone to see methods as boring tools (or even as a necessary but unpleasant step on the road to results), any common method was once daring and controversial.  This seminar will cover very recent developments in both qualitative and quantitative social scientific research methods and attempt to address the question of how new research methods are invented, applied, transferred between problems and disciplines, and formalized.  The overall focus of the course will be research design, rather than learning and procedures of a single method.  In addition, we will spend some time trying to think creatively about possible new methods and designs.  Readings in the course will be split between classics and readings concerning very recent innovations in methods.  In discussion of recent methodological trends, particular attention will be paid to internet / new media research, new digital sources of data (sometimes called "big data" or "e-social science"), spatial / geographic methods, visualization as a research method, and unobtrusive methods.  A goal of the seminar is to encourage researchers to conceptualize methodology - whether using new or old methods - as a creative art.
